# 4 Types of datasets

The term dataset can refer to activity datasets and impact assessment (LCIA) datasets. LCIA datasets are described in
Chapter 4.13. All other sections of this Chapter deal exclusively with activity datasets.

## 4.1 Activity datasets, exchanges and meta-data

An ecoinvent activity dataset represents a unit process of a human activity and its exchanges with the environment and
with other human activities. Several types of datasets are described in the following sub-chapters, but they all have in
common that they have exchanges on the input side and on the output side, see Figure 4.1.

Exchanges from and to the environment, also called elementary exchanges1, are placed on the input side and the output
side respectively.
All other exchanges are intermediate exchanges, i.e. exchanges between activities. On the output side we distinguish
between:

- Reference products
- By-products / Wastes

The distinction between reference products and by-product/wastes is activity-specific, i.e. the same product can be a
reference product of one activity and a by-product/waste of another activity.
These distinctions are described in more detail in the following subchapters.
On the input side, the ecoSpold v2 format allows to differentiate intermediate exchanges into materi- als/fuels (with
mass), electricity/heat (in energy units, without mass) and services (without mass or energy properties), but this
distinction is not actively used in the ecoinvent database. On the output side, the ecoSpold v2 format allows further to
differentiate materials for treatment and stock additions. These distinctions are only used internally in the ecoinvent
database when creating interlinked
datasets, see Chapter4.14.
In addition to the exchanges, the dataset is described in terms of meta-data, i.e. data identifying the activity itself,
in terms of its geographical, technological and temporal validity, the origin, representativeness and validation of the
data, and administrative information. All relevant aspects of these metadata are  described in later Chapters of this report.

## 4.1.1 Exchanges from and to the environment

Exchanges from the environment are resources extracted and chemical reactants from the air (e.g.
CO2, O2, N2), water or soil that enter into a human activity or into biomass harvested in the wild. Also land
transformation, land occupation, and working hours are recorded as exchanges from (services provided by) the natural,
social or economic environment. Also inputs of primary production factors of the economy (labour costs, net taxes, net
operation surplus, and rent, see Chapter6.4) are recorded as exchangesfrom the environment although measured as the
economic expenditures for these inputs.
Exchanges to the environment are emissions to the different environmental compartments (e.g., air, water).
To distinguish human activities from their environment, two principles are followed in combination:

1) “The natural background”, i.e. to include everything that would not have occurred without the activity, and to
   exclude anything that would have occurred even without the activity.
2) “Human management”, i.e. to include everything that takes place under human management and exclude anything that
   takes place after human management has terminated.
   These principles, their limitations, and their practical implementation are further described in Annex A.

## 4.1.2 Reference products

If the activity has only one product output, this is the reference product . The reference product is ei- ther a good or
a service.
An activity with more than one product also has only one reference product, except:
if the activity is a combined production, where the output volumes of the (combined) products can
be varied independently, and the activity therefore can be subdivided into separate activities, each having only one
reference product, see Chapter5.3,
if there are more products from the activity that have no alternative production routes. If more
than one product from a joint production has no alternative production routes, all of these are ref- erence products.
The reference products are those products for which a change in demand will affect the production volume of the
activity  (also known as the determining products in consequential modelling, see Weidema & Ekvall 2009).
In most situations, by-products can easily be distinguished from reference products. Often by-products are close to
waste and are therefore not even fully utilised, for example straw.
The distinction between reference products and by-products is necessary due to its relevance for iden- tifying products
that require additional treatments, e.g. for recycling, and in particular for system models with substitution, where the
supply of by-products are counterbalanced to arrive at single- product activities.
Additional advice for data providers:
For treatment activities, see Chapter 4.8, the reference product is a negative physical flow of the material re- ceived
for treatment, corresponding to the service of treating this material .
Whether an output is a reference product or not can depend on local conditions and can change over time.

Examples of situations with more than one reference product, and additional advice for data providers
are provided in Chapter11.1.
[Changes  relative  to  ecoinvent  version  2:  The  distinction between reference products  and by- products is new. All multi-product activities in version 2 have been reviewed and the reference prod- ucts identified. A number of treatment activities were missing their reference product. These have been added based on information in the original ecoinvent reports . A number of activities in version 2 have reference products that are not goods or services, but refer to a fuel input, e.g. “diesel, burned in building machine” . Often these reference products are used by an activity producing heat. For these activities, all with the term “burned in” in their name, reference products of heat or work have been added, calculated from existing information in the database when available, and the dataset merged with the corresponding heat producing activity, when available. The revised reference products have reviewed by the original dataset authors and/or the editors.]

## 4.1.3 By-products and wastes
The ecoinvent database does not discriminate between by-products and wastes and does not apply any specific waste
definition. Different database users may therefore apply their own waste definitions, if they wish to distinguish wastes
from by-products.
Both wastes and by-products may be – or be transformed to be – valuable inputs to other product sys-
tems. Depending on their need for further treatment or transformation, they may be linked to different
treatment activities, see Chapter4.8.
It follows from the definition of reference products in Chapter4.1.2, that by-product/wastes (any out- put that is
neither a reference product nor an exchange to the environment) must have either an alter- native production route or a
treatment activity that transforms the by-product/waste either into a prod- uct with an alternative production route or
into an exchange to the environment.
[Changes relative to ecoinvent version 2: In ecoinvent version 2, waste treatments are recorded as service inputs to the activities supplying the waste. All such waste treatment services have been re- viewed and expressed as negative outputs of wastes. The name changes have been reviewed by the original dataset authors and/or the editors. For a number of products in version 2 that have now been identified as by-products (e.g. straw, sodium hydroxide), the activities that have the by-product as its reference product or as an input for treatment were missing. These activities have now been added.]
