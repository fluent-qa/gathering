8      Language


8.1      Default language
British English is used as the default language for all names and text fields.

8.2      Language versions
Outlook: Language versions of the ecoinvent database are foreseen and supported by the ecoSpold 2 format. However, the implementation of this has been postponed beyond the release of version 3.0.
Language versions of datasets are produced by translating all text fields and storing the translated text fields with the appropriate 2 letter ISO 639-1 language code, as provided in the language master file.
The language versions are all stored in the same dataset, and can be viewed by choosing the corre- sponding language code as default when requesting to view a dataset.
We encourage data providers to provide translations and initiate systematic translation projects.
[Changes relative to ecoinvent version 2: German names of activities and classifications from ver- sion 2 are not maintained in version 3.]
