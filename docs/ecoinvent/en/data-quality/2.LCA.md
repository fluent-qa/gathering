# 2      LCA methodology

## 2.1      LCI, LCIA and LCA

The ecoinvent database builds on the method of life cycle assessment (LCA) as standardised by International
Organisation for Standardisation  (International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) 2006a; International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2006b). LCA studies systematically and adequately address the environmental
aspects of product systems, from raw material acquisition to final disposal (from "cradle to grave"). The method
distinguishes four main steps, namely (1) goal and
scope definition, (2) inventory analysis, (3) impact assessment, and (4) interpretation (seeFig. 2.1).

Focus of the ecoinvent database is on the compilation of the basic building blocks (LCI datasets), representing the
individual unit processes of human activities and their exchanges with the environment, and the combination of these LCI
datasets through the use of system models in life cycle inventory analysis (LCI), thus constructing life cycle
inventories. Nevertheless, the ecoinvent database also contains data on impact assessment (LCIA) methods and results
of applying these methods to the LCI data. However, the work on LCIA is limited to the implementation of already
developed LCIA methods, such as the ecological scarcity or the Eco-indicator methods. No new ("ecoinvent") method has
been developed (except for the cumulative energy demand, CED, for which no "official" or unified imple- mentation
exists). The implementation of the LCIA methods is done with the aim of giving guidance on how to combine ecoinvent LCI
results with characterisation, damage or weighting factors of cur- rently available LCIA methods.

## 2.2     Attributional and consequential modelling

For life cycle inventory analysis it is common to distinguish between consequential and attributional modelling (see
Ekvall 1999; Frischknecht 1997; Guin√©e et al. 2001; Weidema 2003, Weidema & Ekvall 2009). The ecoinvent database with
its modular structure supplying multi-product unit process
raw data is suited to support both types of system modelling.
LCA system models differ in two aspects:
The linking of inputs to either average or unconstrained suppliers.
The procedures to arrive at single-product systems in situations of joint production of products,
which apply either partitioning (allocation) of the multi-product system into two or more single-product systems, or
substitution (system expansion), which eliminates the by-products by including the counterbalancing changes in supply
and demand on the affected markets.
To allow calculation of the different system models, the following data are required for each activity:
Amounts of the product properties that are applied for allocation (e.g. price, exergy, dry mass,
carbon content).
The distinction of reference products (determining products) from by-products, since the latter
must be eliminated from models using substitution.
Market trends, since consequential models distinguish different suppliers to be affected on shrinking and growing
markets.
Technology level, since consequential models regard only activities with specific technology levels to be affected by
changes in demand.
The specific way these data are included in the individual datasets is described in Chapters 4 to 6. More details on the
construction of different system models are provided in Chapter14.
